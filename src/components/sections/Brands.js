              YOPE has created a curriculum for personal finance which is translated into four video modules.
              Each module ranges from 14 minutes to 35 minutes total and it breaks down the areas of personal finance into easy-to-understand sections.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Most sections consist of short quizzes to reinforce what youâ€™ve learned. 
              Even though everyone's financial situation is different, The Budgeting Module is included with your membership because Yope wants you to first learn how to manage your money!
